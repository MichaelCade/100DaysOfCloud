# Veeam Backup for AWS v3 - Protecting RDS and VPC Configuration

## Cloud Research

Another release but this time it was focused on AWS and the continued approach to protecting and managing data within AWS, v1 was the ability to protect virtual machines or IaaS / EC2 instances, v2 was a performance enhancement and some more granular recovery options alongside centrally manage and deploy the marketplace image to protect the prior mentioned, v3 brings the ability to protect RDS, VPC Configuration, RBAC controls and some more effort about application consistency, I did a walkthrough video demo of the update process and the new features.
