# Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 v5

## Cloud Research

  This update is based on the new release of Veeam Backup for Office 365 v5, mainly aimed at protecting your SaaS based workloads in Office 365 and in particular Teams data alongside the existing capabilities of being able to protect Mail Online, Sharepoint Online and OneDrive for Business. Teams protection is not just about backup of the data its also about the recovery and the new Veeam explorer for Microsoft Teams allows for granular fast recovery of individual items and chat objects back into your live Office 365 environment. 

  I have done a few updates about this over the next few days of this challenge.
