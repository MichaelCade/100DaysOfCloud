CloudSkills.fm Podcasting / YouTube

## Cloud Research

I am not sure if this counts as a day as if I stacked with work where I cannot have hands on the best form of education for me is to pick up a podcast or YouTube (if it doesnt involve actually watching) Last summer I found this podcast and coming from a non cloud and a newbie to the DevOps mantra and thought process, Mike does a great job of walking through many different interesting topics. 

Today I listened to the episode with Mike and Christian Nunciato from Pulumi. It was 

[Episode 88 from CloudSkills] (https://cloudskills.io/blog/episode-088)

As I said I have been a complete n00b in this space for both cloud and other areas of DevOps, but the topic of Infrastructure as code has been of great interest mostly this has been focused on products from HashiCorp such as Terraform. 

What is also really interesting is that Christian was at CHEF prior to Pulumi and this is another area I have been focused on with the creation of the Veeam CHEF cookbook for Day 0 deployment and operations. I cannot take all credit there but it was a steep learning curve to get there. 

I also listened to the finish of the show with Mike and Gwyneth Pena which led me to this #100DaysOfCloud 

Overall I have found the podcast a great resource to dig deeper into Cloud / DevOps / Kubernetes and also a lot about career advice.
