# COM01-AZ200 - Azure VMware Solution

## Introduction

Day 2, I decided to take a look at the 100DaysOfCloudIdeas on the primary repository, link below. The idea for this learning session was to learn more about the Azure VMware Solution that was announced this week at Microsoft Ignite 2020. 

## Use Case

Questions Answered:

- What is bare metal cloud? 
  
  My initial take on Bare Metal Cloud, if we think about IaaS where you get some infrastructure and you can deploy and have your application and workload services running here, Bare metal is going one step further on instead of sharing many different compute platforms (normally the end user would also not have any idea on what these compute nodes were) but bare metal would enable the end user or company to have a specific dedicated physical host where only their data and workloads would maybe run and there would be absolutely no degradation of service with having to compete with other businesses on the shared model. 

- What does AVS provide you with?

  Implementing this solution where IT staff maybe already has fully skilled up on VMware this enables a business to move and start leveraging Microsoft Azure   

- What are AVS Private clouds?
- What are AVS Clusters?
- What are AVS Hosts?
- How often are Private cloud vCenter and NSX-T configurations backed up?
